## DDBB
I have experience in the use of **Databases**, both in the structure, as the creation/understanding of **EER Diagrams**, and in the analysis.
I have worked mainly with **SQL** and the **MySQL** engine, although also with **TSQL** and **SQL Server** for **.NET**, I have experience with **NoSQL** **BDD**s such as **MongoDB** and **Firebase**.
   - With **SQL** using the **MySQL** engine, using **Java**, I implemented an application by **CMD** to implement **CRUD** operations on any **BDD**. also used in my [DAW FYP](<https://github.com/jofaval/tfcgs-daw>), and multiple personal/private projects.
   - With **TSQL** using **SQL** Server engine, using **C#** making use also of **Entity Framework** and **LinQ**, I made my [DAM FYP](<https://github.com/jofaval/tfcgs-dam>).
   - With **MongoDB** I made an application in **C#** to implement **CRUD** operations on any **BDD**.
   - I integrated **Firebase** into a simple **Android** application.
