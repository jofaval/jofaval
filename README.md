<p align="center">I'm a Senior Frontend Engineer with a lot of way ahead, I've learnt some Data Science (non-professionally).</p>

This is my personal Github, I like to try some stuff out (new tech, architecture, concepts) and start projects I might never get the chance to finish.

## Projects Categories

### Software Engineering

I'm looking forward to completing these projects:

- [E-Learning REST API with Golang](https://github.com/jofaval/e-learning)
- [Babylon, Microservices and Microfrontends](https://github.com/jofaval/babylon)

"Big" projects while I was a student

- [Final Degree Project in Software Development](https://github.com/jofaval/tfcgs-dam)
- [Final Degree Project in Web Development](https://github.com/jofaval/tfcgs-daw) (wish I knew about TypeScript)

### Data Science

Mostly analysis, visualizations and machine learning (a little bit of deep learning at times).
