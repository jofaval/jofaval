<h1 align="center">Hi!! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Pepe Fabra Valverde</h1>

I'm a Senior Frontend Engineer with a lot of way ahead in my Software Engineering journey, I've also studied Data Science (non-professionally). This is my personal Github, where I like to try some stuff out (new tech, architecture, concepts) and start projects I might never get the chance to finish (which is... healthy!).

## Contact

The easiest way to contact me is through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jofaval).\
I'm working on my personal page, at a really slow pace, on [jofaval.github.io](https://jofaval.github.io).

## Projects

### Software Engineering

It's what I've done the most projects about, but I'm specially looking forward to complete these projects:

- [E-Learning REST API with Golang](https://github.com/jofaval/e-learning)
- [Babylon, Microservices and Microfrontends](https://github.com/jofaval/babylon)
- [Headless UI TreeView library](https://github.com/jofaval/hui-tree)

### Data Science

Mostly analysis, visualizations and machine learning (a little bit of deep learning at times).
